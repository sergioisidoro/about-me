## Noticed - A news and information aggregator for communities (CTO)
During the Venture Formation course, a full business plan was built from the ground up based on an idea to facilitate information sharing in communities. 
Instead of the traditional mailing lists, facebook groups, and other information sharing channels, all the information would be aggregated in a single application with a hyperlocal chat.
The approach was to minimise the behaviour change, aggregating all the information from existing channels, instead of requesting content producers to adopt a new platform.

The first use case was Aalto University itself.

After the course completion, the materials were presented to Aalto Center for Entrepreneurship, that attributed a seed round investment of 75k Eur for the development of the Solution.
During several months a technical MVP was built, and the first customer (Aalto University) was under piloting stage. 
Due to long sales cycles, and lack of further funding opportunities the project was considered failed

Technologies:
* Python 
* Flask
* SQL Alchemy

# 2015 
## Holvi 

### Operations Engineer (2015-2016)
As an Operations engineer at Holvi my function was to provide support in the development of the back-office tools to help manage the payments system, and other internal requirements. This meant not only backend development, but also feature implementation in customer facing systems (eg. compliance requirements of onboarding). Systems like continuous monitoring of Fraud and Anti-money laundering, backoffice IVR,and automatic reporting to external entities were some of my responsibilities.  

Technologies:
* Python 
* Django
* SQL

### Risk Office (2017- present)
As the organization grew, and since I had developed significant part of the anti-fraud and anti money laundering facilities, I moved to the position of risk officer. In this position I developed and implemented the organization risk management framework based on the standard ISO31000, and later on, developed and implemented the organization IT security management framework based on the standard ISO27000, covering topics such as physical security, authentication mechanisms of Customer Support, training schedules, as well as Change management policies. 

I built a Risk registry using JIRA to track and assign owners to threats to the organization, that included automatic report generation for stakeholders.

Technologies:
* JIRA + Confluence
* Python
* LaTex
* ISO31000
* ISO27000

### Business Analyst (2018 - present)
As addition to the Risk Officer, I assumed the role of Business analyst, supporting the business owners in data driven decision making.

Technologies:
* Scikit learn
* Excell
* Python
* SQL 
* Redash
