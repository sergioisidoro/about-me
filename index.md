# About
I'm a Portuguese ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ Software Engineer ðŸ’» living in Helsinki, Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®

For my Bachelors, I Studied Information Systems and Computer engineering in [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). I was an active member of the student community, ending up representing the 10 000 students in school council, and being a member of the Student union management team.

In 2013 I came as an exchange student to [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi/en/), founded a software company with 2 friends, and latter applied to a full time Masters Degree in Machine Learning and Data mining at Aalto University.

When the company ran out of runway, and ended up failing, I joined [Holvi](www.holvi.com), a payment service provider, as an operations development engineer. In the meantime I dropped out of my Masters degree, moved to a position of risk management and IT security management, as well as business inteligence and analytics.

In 2018 I got back to my roots, joining the development team at [KaikuHealth](https://kaikuhealth.com/), contributing as well to the risk management process development.

# Tech
I don't really know what people want when asking for a "Full stack". 
Front-end with back-end skillz? or a Back-end with front-end skills? Jack of all trades, master of none?

The truth is that I do enjoy building small MVPs end to end, and a can make a prototype in every corner of a product.
My swiss army knife tech stack is: Docker + Flask + SQL Alchemy + Bootstrap

I can deal cards in:
* Software engineering
* Software architecture
* Machine learning and Data mining
* Data analytics / engineering 
* Risk Management (eg. standard ISO31000)
* IT Security Management (eg. standard ISO27000)

### [Aequalis](https://github.com/sergioisidoro/aequalis)
A reproduction of a published paper about methods to remove biases in machine learning models (eg. racial, gender), either pre-existing in the data, or learned by the model.

### [Cognisese](https://github.com/sergioisidoro/cognisense)
A poorly coded hackathon project for server side, near-real time EEG signal acquisition and visualization

### [DjangoLearn](https://github.com/open-holvi/djangolearn)
A way to store machine SciKit learn models for Django, allowing for individually trained models (eg. for each user)

### [McBoatFace](https://github.com/open-holvi/mcboatface)
A subset of Open Face features, wrapped around a flask API to extract and compare facial features. The main objective of this project was to to facilitate KYC (know your customer) and document validation during registration.
